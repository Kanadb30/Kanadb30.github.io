# Portfolio Website README

This is a portfolio website for Kanad Bajpai, showcasing projects, skills, and contact information.

## Editing the Projects Section
1. Navigate to `src/pages/Projects.tsx`.
2. Locate the `Projects` component.
3. Replace the placeholder content with your projects list. A project object structure could be:
```json
{
  "title": "Project Title",
  "description": "Brief description of the project.",
  "githubLink": "https://github.com/username/repository"
}
```
4. Save the file and redeploy the site using your deployment platform.
5. Test the updated Projects page to ensure the new project displays correctly.
